# rust-bufread
Example showing the benefits of [BufRead](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.BufRead.html) in Rust. This is example code for the article [Using `BufRead` for faster Rust I/O speed](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-bufread-faster-rust-io-speed/) on the [LogRocket blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/).

The word_frequency.txt file is pulled from my [Wheel of Fortune solver](https://github.com/gregstoll/wheeloffortune).
